# 90-Day AI Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to the **90-Day AI Upskilling Program** — a structured, hands-on path designed for professionals coming from traditional languages like .NET (C#), C++ MFC, and FORTRAN who now want to enter the AI field using **Python** and real-world projects.

This repository will guide you through all the necessary tools, programming concepts, and AI/ML practices over 90 days, one day at a time. Each day comes with:

* 📚 Theory (with beginner-friendly explanations)
* 💻 Practical coding exercises
* 📓 Jupyter notebooks
* ✅ Real-world mini projects
* ☁️ Deployment, GitHub versioning, and portfolio building

> 💡 All daily lessons are kept in the [`docs/`](docs/README.md) folder for easy access.
