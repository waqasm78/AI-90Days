# Day 5 – Functions in Python 🚀

Welcome to **Day 5** of your AI journey! Today is all about **functions**. Functions are reusable blocks of code that help you organize and modularize your programs. In AI projects, functions are essential for keeping your logic clean, separating responsibilities, and reducing repetition.

---

## 🌟 Objectives

- Learn how to define and call Python functions
- Understand how to pass arguments and return values
- Explore advanced topics like default values, keyword arguments, and variable-length arguments
- Build real-world AI-relevant utilities using functions

---

## 📁 Setup Instructions

1. Activate your virtual environment and create a Day 5 folder:
```bash
cd AI-90Days
ai_env\Scripts\activate
mkdir Day5_Functions
cd Day5_Functions
set JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR=%CD%\jupyter_runtime
jupyter notebook
```

2. Create a new notebook: `day5_functions.ipynb`

## 🔍 What is a Function?

Functions are containers for code that perform specific tasks. Once defined, a function can be called multiple times, allowing code reuse and better structure. This is especially useful in AI to organize tasks like loading data, preprocessing it, or evaluating models. Instead of rewriting the same code, you just call the function where needed.

---

## ✏️ Defining a Simple Function

Use the `def` keyword to define a function. Then call the function using its name.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from a function!")

greet()
```

This simple function prints a greeting message. Functions without parameters are useful when the logic is fixed.

---

## 🧰 Parameters and Arguments

Functions can take parameters (placeholders) so you can pass data when calling them.

```python
def greet_user(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet_user("Waqas")
```

Here, `name` is a parameter. You pass "Waqas" as an argument during the function call. This allows for dynamic input.

---

## ➡️ Returning Values

You can use the `return` keyword to send back a result from a function.

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(5)
print("Square of 5 is:", result)
```

Returning values is key when building pipelines in AI — you pass data from one function to another for transformation.

---

## 🧩 Types of Function Arguments

Understanding argument types is crucial to writing flexible and reusable code.

### 1. Default Arguments

These are parameters that assume a default value if no value is provided by the caller.

```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    print("Hi", name)

greet()           # Output: Hi Guest
greet("Ayesha")   # Output: Hi Ayesha
```

Default arguments simplify your code by making parameters optional.

### 2. Keyword Arguments

Instead of relying on the order of arguments, you can specify the parameter names explicitly.

```python
def profile(name, age):
    print("Name:", name)
    print("Age:", age)

profile(age=30, name="Ali")
```

This improves clarity and allows arguments to be passed in any order.

### 3. Variable-Length Arguments (*args)

When you're unsure how many values will be passed, use `*args` to collect them into a tuple.

```python
def sum_all(*numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    print("Total:", total)

sum_all(1, 2, 3)       # Output: Total: 6
sum_all(10, 20)        # Output: Total: 30
sum_all()              # Output: Total: 0
```

🔎 **Explanation**:

- `*numbers` collects all values into a tuple
- You can iterate through it like a list
- Useful when building utility functions that accept dynamic inputs

💡 **Real-world analogy**:

Think of `*args` like a shopping basket. You don’t know how many items someone will add, so you design it to hold any number of items.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case: Normalize Data

Before feeding data to a model, we usually normalize it.
```python
def normalize(data):
    min_val = min(data)
    max_val = max(data)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in data]

scores = [20, 50, 80, 100]
print("Normalized Scores:", normalize(scores))
```

This function scales values to a 0–1 range, a common preprocessing step in ML and neural networks.

## 🔹 Practice Exercises

### 1. Prime Checker

Create a function to check whether a number is prime.
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print("Is 17 prime?", is_prime(17))
print("Is 10 prime?", is_prime(10))
```

### 2. Factorial Function

Write a function that returns the factorial of a number using a loop.

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

print("Factorial of 5:", factorial(5))
```

### 3. Vowel Counter

Write a function that counts how many vowels are in a given string.

```python
def count_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

print("Number of vowels:", count_vowels("Artificial Intelligence"))
```

These are great mini-problems to sharpen your function skills.
